            <h1 class="mainheader">My Top 5</h1>
            <p class="top5intro">Everyone in the world has a favorite film, and probably even a top 5 or 10 favorite films. On this page, I will go over my personal top 5 favorite movies, and why I put them up there. Along with the ratings I will put a brief synopsis of the film, what I thought of it, and the people who starred in it. While it is my personal opinion, I do believe that every one of these films is great, and brings something different to the table. While it changes every so often when a new movie comes out, or I see a new movie, this the current ranking.</p>

            <h2 class="headingleft">The Dark Knight</h2>
            <ul class="textleft">
                <li>Released in 2008</li>
                <li>Starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart</li>
                <li>Directed by Christopher Nolan</li>
                <li>10/10</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="parleft">The second installment of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy, the Dark Knight turns up the stakes even higher than the first. This movie is led by Cristian Bale`s Batman and Heath Ledger`s dastardly performance as the Joker. It is so great because of the depth of the characters, and the weight of the plot. Every moment counts, and the characters are rich. Also, the story is just so amazing, and Batman is a very cool character!</p>

            <h2 class="headingright">Top Gun: Maverick</h2>
            <ul class="textright">
                <li>Released in 2022</li>
                <li>Starring Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Glen Powell</li>
                <li>Directed by Josesph Kosinski</li>
                <li>10/10</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="parright">This movie is only second because I haven`t seen it as many times, and could easily take over first in time. The first time I saw this movie was actually on my couch, and it captivated me. The story is amazing, but even better is the way the movie is shot, and the cinematography. The movie is just beautiful to watch. Every scene takes you in, and it helps that the actors were being legit with their reactions. They actually went up in F-18`s and their reactions are not acting, but genuine. Also, with a killer score and a great story, it makes for a great movie.</p>

        <section id="spiderman2">
            <h2 class="headingleft">Spider-Man 2</h2>
            <ul class="textleft">
                <li>Released in 2004</li>
                <li>Starring Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco</li>
                <li>Directed by Sam Raimi</li>
                <li>9.5/10</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="parleft">This is one of the all time superhero movies. Something about the goofiness of this film puts it miles ahead, as well as a good bit of nostalgia. Spider-Man is just a character that many can relate to, someone who wants to be a better person, but on the inside is just a kid. It is very easy to relate to him, and the struggles he goes through in the movie. Also, the villain is crafted to perfection and played very well. The only bad thing about this movie is its age, as it is a little old and some of the effects can be seen from that. </p>

        <section id="forrestgump">
            <h2 class="headingright">Forrest Gump</h2>
            <ul class="textright">
                <li>Released in 1994</li>
                <li>Starring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise</li>
                <li>Directed by Robert Zemeckis</li>
                <li>9/10</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="parright">This film is an all time classic, and one of the best feel good movies out there. This follows the story of Forrest Gump, a local goofball from southern Mississippi, whose life ends up being full of wonder and excitement. This movie is very good, and it can make a grown man cry. Forrest has ups and downs in his life, and by the end of it you feel like you`ve been a part of his life forever. </p>

            <h2 class="headingleft">Creed</h2>
            <ul class="textleft">
                <li>Released in 2015</li>
                <li>Starring Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson</li>
                <li>Directed by Ryan Coogler</li>
                <li>9/10</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="parleft">This is the story of Adonis Creed, son of Apollo Creed who was the antagonist turned protagonist of the original Rocky franchise. Adonis wants to make a name for himself, so he begins training under Rocky Balboa, who was the main character of the previous franchise. Wanting to make a name for himself, he makes his ranks up the professional boxing level. This is a very good movie, and not only has amazing choreography for a boxing movie, but a very emotional undertone.</p>
