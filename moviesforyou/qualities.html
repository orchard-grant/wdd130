                <h2 class="qualhead">Plot</h2>
                <p>Plot If there are plot holes, the movie is gonna falter. A plot must be concise, yet make sense. When a plot is developing, and then it takes another direction, in my opinion, that hurts the movie. A plot takes time, and cannot be rushed or else it can harm a movie. Also, the plot should always have what's knowns as an "inciting incident", meaning something that propels the conflict forward, and initiates the main conflict. Everything should build up to that main conflict, and the climax shoudl be done to perfection.</p>

                <h2 class="qualhead">Likeability of characters</h2>
                <p>If the people who write the characters write them as dislikable, how can they expect the audience to like the characters? It would be pretty hard. Good writing leads to likable characters, those that we can relate to. Some of my favorite movies include my favorite characters, and that is not a coincidence.</p>

                <h2 class="qualhead">Rememberance</h2>
                <p>Ability to remember A movie must be memorable. If not, how can we expect it to be one of our favorites? I don`t have a lot of quotes memorized, but I have a lot of parts of movies memorized, just because they are so memorable.<p>
