        Welcome to Movies for You! My name is Grant Orchard, and I love movies. I have seen many movies over the years, but I would hardly call myself a critic. This is a personal site where I, Grant Orchard, share opinions on movies and break down what I believe can make a good movie.

        My Top 5

The Dark Knight
Released in 2008, starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart
Directed by Christopher Nolan
10/10
The second installment of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy, the Dark Knight turns up the stakes even higher than the first. This movie is led by Cristian Bale’s Batman and Heath Ledger’s dastardly performance as the Joker. It is so great because of the depth of the characters, and the weight of the plot. Every moment counts, and the characters are rich. Also, the story is just so amazing, and Batman is a very cool character!
Top Gun: Maverick
Released in 2022, starring Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Glen Powell
Directed by Joseph Kosinski
10/10
This movie is only second because I haven’t seen it as many times, and could easily take over first in time. The first time I saw this movie was actually on my couch, and it captivated me. The story is amazing, but even better is the way the movie is shot, and the cinematography. The movie is just beautiful to watch. Every scene takes you in, and it helps that the actors were being legit with their reactions. They actually went up in F-18’s and their reactions are not acting, but genuine. Also, with a killer score and a great story, it makes for a great movie.
Spider-Man 2
Released in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire, Kirsent Dunst, James Franco
Directed by Sam Raimi
9.5/10
This is one of the all time superhero movies. Something about the goofiness of this film puts it miles ahead, as well as a good bit of nostalgia. Spider-Man is just a character that many can relate to, someone who wants to be a better person, but on the inside is just a kid. It is very easy to relate to him, and the struggles he goes through in the movie. Also, the villain is crafted to perfection and played very well. The only bad thing about this movie is its age, as it is a little old and some of the effects can be seen from that.
Forrest Gump
Released in 1994, starring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary SInise
Directed by Robert Zemeckis
9/10
This film is an all time classic, and one of the best feel good movies out there. This follows the story of Forrest Gump, a local goofball from southern Mississippi, whose life ends up being full of wonder and excitement. This movie is very good, and it can make a grown man cry. Forrest has ups and downs in his life, and by the end of it you feel like you’ve been a part of his life forever. 
Creed
Released in 2015, starring Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson.
Directed by Ryan Coogler
9/10
This is the story of Adonis Creed, son of Apollo Creed who was the antagonist turned protagonist of the original Rocky franchise. Adonis wants to make a name for himself, so he begins training under Rocky Balboa, who was the main character of the previous franchise. Wanting to make a name for himself, he makes his ranks up the professional boxing level. This is a very good movie, and not only has amazing choreography for a boxing movie, but a very emotional undertone.

      <h3>Movie qualities</h3>
      <p>
        In my opinion, what makes a movie good? Well, I think that there are several things that can make a movie good. I personally, don’t really care for critic scores and don’t think that determines what makes a movie good. On this page, I will outline a couple of characteristics that can make a movie good.

Plot
If there are plot holes, the movie is gonna falter. A plot must be concise, yet make sense. When a plot is developing, and then it takes another direction, in my opinion, that hurts the movie. A plot takes time, and cannot be rushed or else it can harm a movie.

Likeability of characters
If the people who write the characters write them as dislikable, how can they expect the audience to like the characters? It would be pretty hard. Good writing leads to likable characters, those that we can relate to. Some of my favorite movies include my favorite characters, and that is not a coincidence.

Ability to remember
A movie must be memorable. If not, how can we expect it to be one of our favorites? I don’t have a lot of quotes memorized, but I have a lot of parts of movies memorized, just because they are so memorable.
